    <h2>The Story of the Universe</h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few years ago I read &ldquo;Life 3.0&rdquo; by Max Tegmark, and I&rsquo;m still pulling inspiration from it. The ideas about Entropy and the emergence of life were really new to me. It felt like the first time taking a philosophy class. Tegmark explains how the emergence of life on Earth has led to an increase in the utilization of energy. Living organisms extract and consume energy from their environment to sustain their growth, reproduction, and other life processes. This energy utilization contributes to a decrease in entropy at the local level, as living systems create order and complexity within themselves while simultaneously releasing waste energy into the surroundings, increasing entropy globally. The tendency for global entropy to increase is the second law of thermodynamics and it appears that biological life is the greatest accelerant for this most basic heart beat of the universe. Tegmark suggests that this could be interpreted as the will of the Universe.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then these past 12 months I became familiar with Michael Saylor&rsquo;s ideas about the thermodynamics of power (energy), money and civilizations. We advance because of our ability to generate and deploy ever larger quantities of energy. Human progress is a story of energy. The term &lsquo;Power&rsquo; is synonymous with ability, influence, status, and value, but more importantly it is also a measure of work output. The power of one horse (HorsePowers) or 1 Amp at 1 Volt of pressure(Watts) or the amount of rotational force generated (foot-pounds) are all measures of power. But so is economic wealth, political influence, and the ability to conquer new land. Physical power and Socioeconomic power are two sides of the same coin.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of Saylor&rsquo;s best tautologies:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&ldquo;Whoever has the most power is the most powerful&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So essentially both local human action and the basic physics of the universe were motivated to expend as much energy as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combining these two foundational ideas was profound for me. It seemed to offer a coherent story for the universe. And further it gave a spiritual meaning to the endeavor of computation and specifically Bitcoin&rsquo;s proof of work. That universal story goes like this:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Universe has an imperative to increase entropy and reach the heat death as soon as possible &gt;&gt;&gt; emergence of life on Earth and potentially elsewhere in the universe has led to an increase in the utilization of energy and therefore an increase in global entropy &gt;&gt;&gt; As life evolved and advanced, the consumption and utilization of energy increased significantly. Over time, organisms developed more sophisticated ways to exploit and deploy energy &gt;&gt;&gt; This deployment of energy is our highest calling as beings in the universe &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The development of computers and eventually the Bitcoin network is an ultimate manifestation of this trend. This computing process expends a considerable amount of energy, and is an ultimate purified expression of the will of the Universe (God).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Note: This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bull case for BTC. It is totally possible to substitute Bitcoin proof of work with something like computing digits of Pi. Seems just as inspiring.&nbsp;</span></p>
